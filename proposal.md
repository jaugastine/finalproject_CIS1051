# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Crescentia Book Nook

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An immesrive website that lets you explore a bookstore where you can read and rent books.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will let the user "walk" through a bookstore, allowing them to browse and select books off a bookshelf. The bookshelfs will only show the spines of the book, so its authentic to the real experience of browsing a bookstore. The user can click on a book and they will be prompted with three choices: to save the book to the "read later" page, to be transported to an ambient cafe to start reading, or to rent/buy the book. 

The "read later" page lets users save books that they would like to look as they are browsing. There, the books will be displayed in more uniform, grid style format. The reading cafe will be an environment where the user can have the book in front of them to read. After a certain amount of pages, the book will not let the reader continue without renting or buying. 

I would use Javascript to execute this project.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would need to learn how to implement graphics and possibly animation into javascript.
