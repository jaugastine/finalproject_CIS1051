# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Crescentia Moon's Book Nook

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An immersive website that lets you explore a bookstore where you can read and rent books.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will let the user "walk" through a bookstore, allowing them to browse and select books off a bookshelf. The bookshelfs will only show the spines of the book, so its authentic to the real experience of browsing a bookstore. The user can click on a book and they will be prompted with three choices: to save the book to the "read later" page, to be transported to an ambient cafe to start reading, or to rent/buy the book. The "read later" page lets users save books that they would like to look as they are browsing. There, the books will be displayed in more uniform, grid style format. The reading cafe will be an environment where the user can have the book in front of them to read. After a certain amount of pages, the book will not let the reader continue without renting or buying. I would use Javascript to execute this project. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I would like to combine this project with my Web Service Programming(MIS3502) final project. The aspects that would relate to 1051 would be the how I design the website with graphics and interactive features. In my MIS classes, the general outline of websites we make are quite plain and boring, so I would be challenging myself on the user interface. The aspects that would relate to the my Web Service Programming class would be that I would host the website on AWS and the website would need to comply with accesibility guidelines.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- picture of a book that it clickable
- description page for book 
- button that lets you checkout
- an ambient background/music

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?


- picture of a book that it clickable
- ket reader read first chap of a book in pdf or e-book form
- description page for book 
- button that lets you checkout
- read later page that saves books to a new page
- an ambient background/music

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?


- Bookshelf style deign that lets users click on specfic book
- cafe style reading page that lets users flip through pages in a first-person pov
- sound affects for every action
- timer for reading book instead of locked chapter
- read later page
- an ambient background/music

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would need to learn how to implement graphics and possibly animation into javascript. I will research how react.js works and if I can implement it. I will also look into different websites and games to see if they were able to achieve a similar bookstore design like how I want. One last thing that I would need to do is sharpen my art and adobe skills  since the designs I want will not be easy to search up.
