Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I created a free library website that lets people borrow from a selection of books (added through a sql database). I have created the general outline of the website, with a "bookshelf" design using a table, and depending on the user, you can add books to a personal shelf, return the books, create new books for the community shelf, and delete them.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't added a third party api to get the pages of the books yet. I also want to create an admin only interface to my website and make the overall html look "prettier".

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had difficulties creating the bookshelf design and making the books spines integrate cleanly. In the end I changed my orginally idea or displaying the spines of the book to displaying the book cover, and that ended up being better.
