# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A mobile app that lets you take pictures of clothes you have and creates a virtual closet so you can visually create outfits. 

A website that looks like a bookshelf/bookstore that lets you browse through books and buy/rent online books in a engaging way. Acts as an alternative to those who many have disabilties or reasons that prevent them from going to in-person bookstores.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If I wanted to do the idea with the virtual bookstore, do I need to have a functional purchasing/renting system or can I just have a checkout form that doesn't actually do anything with the costumer's information but would conceptually represent the purchasing process.
