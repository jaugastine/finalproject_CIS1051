# finalproject_CIS1051
Final project for CIS1051 fall 2024

My porject's overall purpose was to provide free access to books for lower-income individuals, with a fun design of a bookshelf to make the experience unique.

One thing that I changed was the name, simply out of convenience, since my last name was too long.

During the development of my project, I encountered challenges while creating the admin interface. I couldn't get the logo home button to work and decided that I should scrap it and make a navigation bar link instead, which ended up working out. 

Initially, I envisioned a more complex, pretty design, but as the project progressed, I realized that time was a significant constraint, especially with my other resposbilities at school. I had to adjust my expectations and focus more on the functionality of the website rather than the design. 

In the end, prioritizing the user experience and ensuring that the platform worked smoothly helped me overcome the pressure to make everything perfect.
